# Teleportation

*Teleportation* is a lightweight protocol for making already developed content available to other servers to enable discovery outside of the traditional search engine flow.

[Here is a quick video of what teleportation can do][video]

## Overview

I would like to introduce you to [the spatty][spatty].
The spatty is my favorite product from Shark Tank, and thus one of my favorite products ever.

What is a spatty you ask?
It's a little spatula you can use to get the remnants of goopy stuff out of bottles. 
I mean look at the video on their site, just people spattyin' out stuff and a buy now call to action.
Perfect name, dynamite presentation and execution, great word-of-mouth appeal, just all around great.

So why is it when I google for the spatty, I get a row of amazon and walmart links, and links to knock offs?

I kind of want to rant about that here, but I'll save it for a supplementary doc (coming soon), but suffice it to say to lose out on search engine results for the name of the product that you made up is just brutal.
Amazon and Walmart aren't shelving spatties for free, they're taking a big ol' cut.
And poor Cheryl's got to shell out for SEO and marketing just to stay up on the board.

Teleportation wants to offer a different path for the spatties of the world.
